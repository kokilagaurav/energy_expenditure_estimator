# Energy Expenditure Estimator

A machine learning project to predict calorie expenditure during physical activities using physiological and activity data. The model is optimized for **Root Mean Square Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)** evaluation metric.

## Project Overview

This project develops a regression model to estimate energy expenditure (calories burned) based on:
- Personal characteristics (Age, Gender, Height, Weight)
- Physiological measurements (Heart Rate, Body Temperature)  
- Activity duration

## Dataset Description

### Features
- **id**: Unique identifier
- **Gender**: Male/Female
- **Age**: Age in years
- **Height**: Height in cm
- **Weight**: Weight in kg
- **Duration**: Exercise duration in minutes
- **Heart_Rate**: Heart rate during exercise (bpm)
- **Body_Temp**: Body temperature during exercise (°C)

### Target Variable
- **Calories**: Energy expenditure in calories (to be predicted)

## Data Preprocessing Pipeline

### 1. Data Cleaning
- **Missing Values**: No missing values found in the dataset
- **Outlier Removal**: Applied systematic outlier filtering based on physiological limits:
  - Height: 125-220 cm
  - Weight: 40-120 kg  
  - Heart Rate: 50-120 bpm
  - Body Temperature: ≥35°C

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **Body Temperature Transformation**: Applied squared transformation to reduce skewness
- **Outlier Detection**: Removed anomalous combinations:
  - High calories (>190) with short duration (<10 min)
  - Very low calories (<5) with long duration (>25 min)
  - Low body temperature (<38.4°C) with long duration (>20 min)

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- **Numerical Features**: MinMax scaling for continuous variables
- **Categorical Features**: One-hot encoding for gender (drop first to avoid multicollinearity)

## Model Development

### Evaluation Metric: RMSLE
Root Mean Square Logarithmic Error is used as the primary evaluation metric:
```
RMSLE = √(mean((log(actual + 1) - log(predicted + 1))²))
```

### Models Evaluated
1. **Linear Regression**: Baseline linear model
2. **Random Forest**: Ensemble method with 200 trees, max_depth=15
3. **Gradient Boosting**: Boosting algorithm with 200 estimators, learning_rate=0.1
4. **Voting Regressor**: Ensemble combining all three models

## Model Performance Results

### RMSLE Performance Achieved:
Based on our comprehensive analysis, we achieved significant improvements in model performance through RMSLE optimization:

- **Random Forest**: 0.0614 (Best individual model)
- **Gradient Boosting**: 0.0721 (Second best)
- **Voting Regressor**: 0.2529 (Ensemble approach)
- **Linear Regression**: 0.6057 (Baseline)

### Key Performance Improvements:

**1. Random Forest Optimization:**
- Achieved the **lowest RMSLE of 0.0614**
- Strong performance with ensemble learning approach

**2. Gradient Boosting Performance:**
- RMSLE of 0.0721, second-best individual model
- Sequential learning effectively captured complex patterns
- Good balance between bias and variance
- **R² Score**: ~0.80-0.85 (Good model fit)

**3. RMSLE Optimization Success:**
- **90% improvement** over baseline Linear Regression model
- Better handling of percentage errors rather than absolute errors
- Reduced impact of large prediction outliers
- More appropriate for calorie prediction where relative accuracy matters

### Why Our Approach Worked:

**1. Logarithmic Transformation Benefits:**
- Log-scale visualization demonstrates excellent linear relationship
- Strong correlation between log(actual) and log(predicted) values
- Minimal scatter around the diagonal line indicates high prediction accuracy

**2. Model Architecture Improvements:**
